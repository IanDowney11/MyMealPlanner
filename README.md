# Meal Planner PWA â€” React + Vite

This project provides a foundational setup for building a mobile-friendly, offline-capable meal planning web app using React with Vite. It features fast development, hot module replacement (HMR), and a minimal ESLint configuration to keep your code clean.

## Features included

- React base with Vite bundling and dev server
- ESLint setup for code quality
- Basic PWA support (manifest and service worker placeholders)
- Flexible project structure to add recipes, meal plans, and shopping lists

## Next steps

- Customize and expand the UI and components for meal planning
- Implement persistent storage via IndexedDB or backend
- Integrate AI recipe suggestions (using Goose.ai, Claude.ai)
- Add user account and sync features for multi-device access
- Improve styling and responsiveness for mobile devices

## Optional: TypeScript support

If desired, you can enable TypeScript and strict linting by following the [React TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts).
